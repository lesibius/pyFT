# General Development
- [] Write constant tables in capital letters (e.g. `SEARCHABLE` instead of `searchable`
- [] Automatic update of constant tables through the API
- [] Add FTFacet in FTHelper
- [] Use FTFacet to generate a double request with some parametrization
- [] Manage dates

# FTRequest Specific Development
- [] Add publishedBefore method


# FTQuerySyntax Specific Development
- [] Add FTExact (extends FTBasic or FTSearch?) for exact match. NOTE: I had an 5** or 4** error with one of my previous request. Might be related to `"` vs `\"`
